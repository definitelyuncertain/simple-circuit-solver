========================================================================

This is a standalone circuit solver that I wrote for a course which 
uses only the standard C library and gnuplot for plotting. It is capable
of AC as well as DC simulation, and accepts a SPICE-like netlist.

To compile :

gcc cksolver.c -lm -o solver


To execute with the given RC filter example netlist :

./solver rc.txt
